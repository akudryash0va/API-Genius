    "OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Genius\" service is of an immence popularity among the alternative\n",
    "music hosts such as soundcloud, apple music, spotify and vk.music due to\n",
    "its functionality in terms of lyrics' provision. It allows the user to \n",
    "access the text of the desired songs. In order make the procedure more swift\n",
    "and enlarge the scope of optionality within a minor framework, created in\n",
    "python, the programme, enabling the search by either the name of the composition, \n",
    "or the artist, was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "GOAL\n",
    "\n",
    "The following project is aimed at the exploration of the Api interface,\n",
    "provided by the developers' segment of \"genius.com\", via the creation of programme,\n",
    "reflecting the \"search\" functionality and aggregating the summarised data, freely\n",
    "available on the referenced website.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROCEDURE\n",
    "\n",
    "The app proceeds as following:\n",
    "First of all, user is asked to enter the title of the track or the name of the artist.\n",
    "Afterwards, the programm scopes tyhrough the genius website and produces a table of contents,\n",
    "including ten top-results. Above the table the number of viewers of the artist's page is generated.\n",
    "It refers to the primary result, as it is to be considered the most relevant.\n",
    "Following this procedure, an interactive window is visualised, allowing user to authorize on the website,\n",
    "or, in case of denial, choose between the two (or both) options, providing one with the direct links to\n",
    "the artist's account.\n",
    "\n",
    "RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Genius\" provides the developers with diverse optionality, however, it mostly refers to more complex\n",
    "data integration and programme initialization. Therefore, in the following project, the usage of genius\n",
    "app for api creation centered around the usage of token, as there are few particular requests, common for\n",
    "\"genius\". All futher procedures included the usage of, mainly, Json, BeautifulSoup and Pandas. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of limitations refers, primarily, to the contents of the \"genius\" website, in case of \n",
    "information lack, for instance, album cover, the programme will not be able to provide user with a visualization, \n",
    "however, this could have been maintained by either addittion of code, accounting for exclusion, or improvised \n",
    "sample picture. Addittionally, the process of automatical authorisation via the current app is denied due to the \n",
    "policy of the website (because of this, users are forwarded towards the authorisation page in the browser). \n",
    "Steps for errors eradication were suggested at the end of the project, but are to be reconsidered in more details\n",
    "in terms of the current problem as the solutions were extracted from the open sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of numerical values, produced by the app, the process of data visualization is \n",
    "constrained. A more detailed analysis of \"Genius\" API guidlenie is required to access more statistically valuable\n",
    "features. On the whole, the programme summarises and reflect the optionality of the website and provides swift\n",
    "acces to the desired data, therefore, representing a quick, \"amateur\" alternative. \n"
